**Java Development Internship  Oasis-InfoByte**

This repository is a showcase of my journey in software development, featuring a collection of projects where I've applied my skills and creativity. Each project represents a unique challenge and an opportunity for growth. Let's dive in and explore together!

**Project-1 Online Reservation System**

My initial project involved developing an online examination system, marking my foray into web development. This endeavor provided me with invaluable insights into crafting a user-friendly interface tailored for online exams. During the project, I successfully integrated features like user authentication, an exam timer, and automated answer submission. Additionally, I gained proficiency in utilizing Java technologies such as Servlets and JSPs to build dynamic web pages, further enhancing my skill set in the field.

**Project-2 Number Guessing Game **

For my second project, I undertook the development of a number-guessing game. Despite its apparent simplicity, this project played a significant role in honing my logical thinking and problem-solving abilities. I successfully incorporated functionalities like restricting the number of attempts, expanding the number of rounds, and presenting a score based on the user's attempts. Moreover, this project served as a platform for refining my comprehension of Java programming principles, including loops, conditional statements, and object-oriented programming concepts.During the development of this game, I had an immense amount of fun.

**Project-3 ATM Interface**

For my third project, I embarked on creating an ATM interface, which proved to be the most challenging endeavor of the series. This project required me to develop a console-based application that simulated the functionalities of an ATM machine. I was tasked with implementing various features such as presenting a menu of options, prompting user input, and updating account balances based on user actions. Through this project, I further refined my skills in Java programming, particularly in the manipulation of classes, objects, and methods.

**Project-4 Online Examination **

For my final project, I designed an online examination system, leveraging Java technologies like Servlets and JSPs. This project aimed to facilitate remote exams with features including user authentication, timed assessments, and automatic submission. Overcoming challenges in concurrent user management and security enhanced my problem-solving skills. The completion of this project marked a significant milestone in my journey, showcasing my proficiency in web development.
